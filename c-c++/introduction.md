# Introduction

## Features

The implementation of DID Native SDK conforms to [W3Câ€™s DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) specification and verifiable credential specification - the main function set is as follows:

* DID and DIDDocument
* Verifiable credential
* Verifiable presentation
* Hierarchical Deterministic DIDs (similar with [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki))
* Secure local DID objects store
* DID and credential publishing mechanism base on Elastos ID side chain

In addition, because [JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://jwt.io/) is widely used, the key of DID can be used for signing and verifying JWT. Therefore, the Elastos DID SDK integrates the support of JWT, which provides a safe and convenient way to use JWT for applications, and there is no risk of key leakage. The JWT integrated by Native DID SDK provides the following support:

* JWT
* JWS (algorithm: ECDSA using P-256 and SHA-256)
* Claims assertions
* Claim POJO marshaling and unmarshaling
