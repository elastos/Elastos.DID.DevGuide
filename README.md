# Introduction

## Elastos DID Framework

The **Elastos DID framework** is a set of APIs that's compatible with W3C DIDs specs.

## Language support

## EID Sidechain

Elastos DID runs on the Elastos Identity Chain (EID) and is based on Ethereum chain. It issues DIDs to any device or individual that needs a trust-based system, which is exactly what the SmartWeb is designed for.

## EID RPC Service for DID SDK

JSON-RPC interface is utilized by Elastos to provide parsing methods of DID and verifiable credentials. Elastos defines the interface specification for parsing or querying DID and credential on EID side chain.
